# Burger Order App
## Description
This application allows the user to place an order for a burger, which is then displayed below with a button adjoined to it. The button is called devouer and if the user clicks it then it is assumed the burger has been consumed and moves to the right side if the screen. ORM was utilised to allow for easier sql query calls and updates, allowing the users input to be inserted into the sql database and be called back, and allow for a boolean value of whether the burger was consumed or not to be updated.
## User Story
As a foodie who has ordered a burger
When I devouer the burgers
Then I am presented with a list of burgers consumed
